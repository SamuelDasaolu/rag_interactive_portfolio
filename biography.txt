## Early Professional and Technical Formation (2024)

In 2024, Samuel Dasaolu was actively engaged in hands-on automotive engineering practice at **Automedics Limited**, a Nigerian automobile repairs and maintenance firm specializing primarily in light trucks and passenger vehicles. His work routine typically began at **8:00 AM**, involving workshop sanitation, tool preparation, and formal reporting under an assigned supervising technician.

During this period, Samuel combined fieldwork with structured technical education. He attended an **automobile diagnosis class organized by Automedics** on **Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays**, typically scheduled from **2:00 PM to 4:00 PM**. These classes emphasized modern vehicle diagnostics, electronic control systems, and transmission technologies.

### Notable Workshop Activities and Technical Tasks

* **Toyota Hilux:** Full-day replacement of a damaged clutch disc.
* **Honda Pilot:** Torque converter replacement, during which a worn shaft failed due to mechanical degradation.
* **Toyota Highlander:** Transmission servicing.
* **Mitsubishi L200:** General engine tune-up and lubrication service performed under the supervision of Mr. Segun.

These tasks reflect early exposure to drivetrain systems, fault diagnosis, mechanical-electronic integration, and real-world failure modes in automotive systems.

Environmental factors occasionally impacted operations; for example, one midweek workshop session was missed due to heavy rainfall, highlighting the practical constraints of field-based engineering work.

## Transition Toward Embedded Systems and Smart Infrastructure (2025)

By 2025, Samuel’s technical focus expanded beyond automotive systems into **embedded systems engineering** and **smart infrastructure development**. This transition marked a shift from purely mechanical-electrical systems toward cyber-physical systems integrating sensors, microcontrollers, data processing, and networked control.

### Smart Water Purification System Project

Samuel undertook a major embedded systems project titled **“Smart Water Purification System”**, which later became both a formal technical report and the basis for a journal article submission.

#### Core Hardware and System Components

* ESP32 microcontroller
* Sensors:

  * Total Dissolved Solids (TDS)
  * pH sensor
  * Turbidity sensor
  * Temperature sensor
  * Flow sensor
  * Pressure sensor
  * Hall-effect sensor
* Actuators and Outputs:

  * Solenoid valve
  * DC pump
  * UV purification lamps
  * LED indicators
* Interfaces:

  * I2C LCD display
  * Clock module
* Filtration Units:

  * Reverse Osmosis (RO) filter
  * Sediment filter

#### System Functionality

The system was designed to:

* Acquire real-time water quality and flow data via analog and digital sensors
* Display system status locally on an I2C LCD
* Transmit processed data to a **Blynk server** for remote monitoring
* Automatically control water flow and purification processes using actuators
* Detect blockages, abnormal pressure conditions, and system faults

Data filtering and logic control were initially implemented using **procedural programming techniques** on the ESP32 platform.

#### Demonstration Limitation and Project Handover

During the final demonstration to the project supervisor, the system could not be powered due to a **failed and non-rechargeable battery**. As a mitigation strategy, Samuel produced a comprehensive **handover and improvement report** intended for a successor.

This report explicitly recommended:

* Migration from procedural logic to **machine learning or AI-based models**
* Long-term water quality trend analysis
* Predictive maintenance and system health monitoring

## Academic Writing and Publication-Oriented Work

Samuel demonstrated increasing engagement with formal technical communication and academic dissemination.

* He adopted structured summarization standards for journal articles, consistently including:

  * Introduction
  * Aims and objectives
  * Methodology
  * Results
  * Limitations

* His revised project report followed the **Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta (FUNAAB), Department of Mechatronics Engineering** formatting guidelines.

* He later prepared a **journal article for NIJOTECH** derived from the Smart Water Purification System, with an explicit requirement that the tone be **humanized and reader-friendly** while retaining technical rigor and compliance with publication standards.

## Applied Artificial Intelligence and Civic Technology Initiatives

Samuel’s work further evolved into **applied AI system design**, particularly in socially impactful domains.

### CivicAccess: The Multilingual Legal First Responder

Samuel conceptualized and refined **CivicAccess**, an AI-powered legal assistant designed to democratize access to justice in Nigeria.

**Core Concept:**
CivicAccess interprets the **Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria** and **Tenancy Laws** into plain, accessible language across multiple Nigerian languages:

* English
* Hausa
* Igbo
* Yoruba

**Primary Use Case:**
Providing real-time legal clarity during police encounters and tenancy disputes, particularly for individuals without immediate access to legal counsel.

This initiative demonstrates Samuel’s shift toward:

* Retrieval-augmented AI systems
* Multilingual NLP
* High-stakes, real-world AI deployment

## Software Engineering and Machine Learning Tooling

Samuel has actively worked with:

* Python-based machine learning workflows
* Jupyter notebooks with structured markdown and executable code blocks
* End-to-end ML pipelines for experimentation and demonstration

He has shown consistent interest in:

* Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
* AI explainability and accessibility
* Human-centered AI system design

## Current Technical Trajectory

At present, Samuel Dasaolu’s trajectory sits at the intersection of:

* Embedded systems and IoT
* Applied machine learning and AI
* Automotive and mechanical-electrical systems
* Civic and infrastructure-focused technology

His work reflects a progression from hands-on mechanical engineering toward **intelligent, data-driven, and socially relevant systems**, with increasing emphasis on AI integration, system robustness, and real-world deployment constraints.
